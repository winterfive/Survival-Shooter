A 3D isometric shooter game created with Unity and C# via the tutorial on Unity's Learn page.

### Custom Code  

 - The tutorial showed how to instantiate enemies from three points with a different enemy(class) at each point.  I added some code to allow all enemies to be created randomly at all the spawn points.
 
 - I added code and animated text so the player could play again.

This repo only includes the code required for this project.
