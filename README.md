### Survival-Shooter

A 3D isometric shooter game created with Unity and C# via the tutorial on Unity's Learn page.

I made one customization to teh game.  The tutorial showed how to instantiate enemies from three points, a different enemy(class) at each point.  I added some code to allow all enemies to be created randomly at all the spawn points.

This repo only includes the code required for this project.
